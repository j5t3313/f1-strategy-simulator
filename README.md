## üèéÔ∏è Quick Start üèéÔ∏è

### Online (Recommended)
Visit the live app: https://f1-strategy-sim.streamlit.app

### Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/j5t3313/f1-strategy-simulator.git
   cd f1-strategy-simulator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
 
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run v3streamlitv4.py
   ```

## üèéÔ∏è How to Use üèéÔ∏è

### 1. Select Circuit
Choose from any of the 24 F1 circuits in the 2025 calendar. The app will automatically adjust strategy parameters for circuit-specific lap counts and characteristics.

A spinner will appear telling you it is checking for race data availability. It may take a moment to load data via the FastF1 API.

### 2. Choose Strategies
Select from pre-defined strategies using the dropdown.

### 3. Configure Parameters
Parameters are automatically selected based on circuit selected, but you can manually adjust them if you'd like.
- **Base Pace**: Adjust the baseline lap time performance
- **Pit Loss**: Set the time penalty for pit stops
- **Tire Allocation**: Optionally define custom tire sets with age per set
- **Simulations**: Choose the number of Monte Carlo runs (100-2000). THESE TAKE TIME TO RUN - THE MORE SIMULATIONS YOU CHOOSE TO RUN, THE LONGER IT WILL TAKE. 

### 4. Analyze Results
The app provides comprehensive analysis including:
- Performance distributions and statistical summaries
- Risk analysis comparing strategies
- Head-to-head win probability matrices
- Export options for further analysis

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- 4GB+ RAM (for Bayesian MCMC modeling)
- Internet connection (for F1 data download)
- ~500MB disk space (for F1 data cache)

### Key Dependencies
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **FastF1**: Official F1 data API for real race data
- **JAX/NumPyro**: High-performance Bayesian statistical modeling with MCMC
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical analysis
- **Matplotlib**: Advanced visualization and PDF export capabilities

## üèéÔ∏è Technical Details üèéÔ∏è

### Data Sources
- **Real F1 Data**: 2024 season race data via FastF1 API for tire performance modeling
- **Circuit Information**: Official lap counts, distances, and fuel consumption calculations
- **Bayesian Tire Models**: MCMC models trained on fuel-corrected lap times vs. stint progression
- **Compound-Specific Parameters**: Different degradation rates and performance characteristics per tire type

### Modeling Approach
- **Fuel Correction**: `Laptime(FC) = Laptime - (Remaining_Laps √ó Fuel_Per_Lap √ó Weight_Effect)`
- **Tire Performance**: Bayesian posterior sampling from `laptime ~ Normal(Œ± + Œ≤ √ó stint_lap, œÉ)`
- **Stochastic Simulation**: Single posterior sample per tire performance calculation
- **Fallback Physics**: Compound-specific degradation models when insufficient data
- **Monte Carlo**: 1000+ simulations per strategy for statistical robustness

### Cache Management
The app automatically creates and manages a `.f1_cache` directory for F1 data caching, improving performance on subsequent runs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Areas for improvement:
- **Enhanced Bayesian models**: Non-linear tire degradation, temperature effects
- **Weather modeling**: Rain probability and wet tire strategies  
- **Safety car simulation**: Historical probability models by circuit
- **Traffic modeling**: Overtaking probability and DRS effects
- **Driver variability**: Performance differences and error modeling
- **Real-time data**: Live timing integration for race weekend use

## üìÑ License

This project is for educational and research purposes. F1 data is accessed through the official FastF1 API under their terms of service.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This simulator is for educational and research purposes only. Actual F1 race strategies depend on numerous factors not fully modeled in this application, including:
- **Real-time variables**: Weather conditions, track temperature, and surface evolution
- **Driver factors**: Individual performance variations, mistakes, and racecraft
- **Race dynamics**: Safety car deployments, VSC periods, and red flag situations  
- **Competitor strategy**: Real-time reactive decisions and strategic games
- **Technical issues**: Reliability problems, damage, and setup compromises
- **Regulatory factors**: Penalty risks, tire pressure monitoring, and technical regulations

**Model Limitations:**
- Based on 2024 data which may not reflect 2025 car/tire characteristics
- Assumes perfect execution without driver errors or suboptimal pit timing
- Linear tire degradation models may miss complex thermal and compound behaviors
- No modeling of track evolution, rubber buildup, or changing grip levels

Results should not be used for actual racing decisions, betting, or gambling purposes. You will absolutely regret it.
